# Budget Tracker Starter Code
Keeping track of personal finances is important - it is extra important for a person who travels often. Their need to track withdrawals and deposits while on the go is essential, hence the reason for the creation of this full-stack web application.

The app runs entirely in the browser, can be accessed from anywhere, and was created utilizing JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. It includes the following features:

* The user is able to use the site with or without an internet connection
* Once the user enters an expense or deposit, they will receive a notification that they have done so
* If the user is offline, once their internet connection is reestablished, then the transactions added while they were offline are added to their history and their totals are updated

# Installation
To install this application, first clone the repo to your local machine. Then, you will need to install the node dependencies/modules which can be done by running the npm install command in your terminal/bash shell.

# Usage
Once the dependencies are installed, to use the application, initialize the server with the following command, npm run start, and it can then be opened locally (or accessed any time via the above deployed site url).
